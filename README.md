# Early-Detection-Of-Plant-Diseases-SVM
This particular project deals with usage of SVM algorithm to help farmers find efficientg and effective method of detection of diseases on plant leaves at an early stage using digital image processing techniques.The attached file consists of the entire implementation in pdf form. The dataset used for the project, was created from scratch where a total of 1500-2000 images were collected from agricultural fields and the same were used in training the algorithm. The diseases considered are : Early Blight, Late Blight, Bacterial spot and Leaf mold.
